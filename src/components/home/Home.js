                The keyboard, a tool that each and every one of us interacts with daily. 
                We probably spend as much time on a keyboard as we do on our phones and 
                while we are constantly looking to own the next flagship device, few look 
                to enhance their typing experiences. The keyboard is often overlooked, 
                possibly never considered by most as something worth investing in, but 
                Taeha Types aims to change that.
